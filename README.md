# Online Advertising Performance Analysis
---
# Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of online advertising campaign performance from April to June 2020. Using a data-driven approach, we transform raw advertising data into a set of actionable insights and strategic recommendations to optimize campaign efficiency and improve Return on Investment (ROI).
---
# üéØ Mission
Our primary goal is to provide a clear, evidence-based strategy for future advertising initiatives by:

1. Increasing Efficiency and ROI: Focusing resources on the most impactful ad combinations and placements. 

2. Enabling Targeted Efforts: Identifying which user segments, banner sizes, and placements are most effective.

3. Gaining a Deeper Understanding: Translating campaign data into a clear, actionable plan.

# üìä Key Findings
Our analysis uncovered several critical insights that can significantly impact future ad performance:

1. User Engagement is Key: The 'High' engagement user segment is the most valuable, contributing almost 80% of all revenue.

2. Top-Performing Creatives: Banner sizes 240x400 and 728x90 consistently drive the highest volume of clicks.

3. Peak Performance Days: Performance metrics such as clicks and conversion rates (CVR) are strongest from Tuesday to Thursday.

4. Synergy in Combinations: A custom "Synergy Score" identified high-potential ad combinations, such as the 300x250 banner on the 'ghi' placement, which delivers exceptional ROAS.

5. Simulated Sales Uplift: A budget reallocation simulation showed that shifting just 10% of the budget from the worst to the best-performing combinations could lead to a sales uplift of 11.19%, representing a gain of over $3.6 million.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach
The analysis was performed using Python and key data science libraries. The workflow followed a disciplined, multi-step process:

1. Data Cleaning: Ensured data integrity by handling missing values and standardizing data types.

2. KPI Engineering: Computed critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as CTR, CVR, ROAS, and CPC to enable a deeper analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized visualizations to uncover trends and patterns in the data.

4. Correlation Analysis: Identified statistical relationships between key variables like cost and revenue.

5. Custom Modeling: Developed a custom Synergy Score to rank ad combinations based on their potential for return.

6. Simulation: Ran a budget reallocation simulation to quantify the financial impact of the strategic recommendations.

# How to Use
Follow these steps to run the analysis locally.

1) Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RiyazShaik27/Online-Advertising-Performance-Analysis
cd Online-Advertising-Performance-Analysis
2) Create and activate a virtual environment
macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
Windows (PowerShell):
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
3) Install dependencies
If requirements.txt is not yet available, install the essentials:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
When requirements.txt is added:
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
4) Launch the notebook
Open ‚ÄúAdvertising Analysis Notebook.ipynb‚Äù in the browser and run cells in order.

Troubleshooting
If plots don‚Äôt render, ensure matplotlib is installed and add:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.show()
If packages install to the wrong interpreter, run installs with python -m pip from the active environment

# üß† Future Work
A/B Testing: Validate the high-potential ad combinations identified by the Synergy Score with live A/B tests.

Predictive Modeling: Develop a predictive model to forecast ROAS based on campaign features.

Interactive Dashboard: Create a web-based dashboard for marketing teams to explore the data dynamically.
